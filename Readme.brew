It looks like Homebrew is either not installed or not properly added to your systemâ€™s PATH. Follow these steps to fix it:

1. Check if Homebrew is Installed

Run this command:

which brew

If it returns nothing, Homebrew is not installed, and you need to install it.

2. Install Homebrew (if not installed)

If brew is not found, install Homebrew using this command:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

3. Add Homebrew to Your PATH

After installation, Homebrew might not be recognized because itâ€™s not in your shellâ€™s PATH. Add it manually:

For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs)

echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

For Intel Macs

echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

4. Verify Homebrew Installation

Run:

brew --version

If this command returns a version number, Homebrew is successfully installed.

5. Proceed with Environment Setup

Once Homebrew is working, you can continue with:

brew update && brew upgrade

Let me know if you run into any issues! ðŸš€
