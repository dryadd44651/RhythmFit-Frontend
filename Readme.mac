To set up your environment on macOS, youâ€™ll need to adjust the instructions slightly since macOS uses Homebrew for package management. Hereâ€™s how you can modify the setup steps for macOS:

â¸»

Set Up Environment on macOS

1. Update Homebrew

First, ensure that Homebrew is up to date:

brew update && brew upgrade

2. Install NVM (Node Version Manager)

macOS does not come with NVM pre-installed, so you need to install it manually:

brew install nvm

After installation, set up NVM by adding the following lines to your ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc if using Bash):

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion"

Then, reload the shell configuration:

source ~/.zshrc

Verify that NVM is installed:

nvm --version

3. Install Node.js and npm

Now, install Node.js (version 16 as per your README):

nvm install 16
nvm use 16

Set Node.js 16 as the default version:

nvm alias default 16

Verify installation:

node -v
npm -v

4. Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install required packages:

cd /Users/huachuang/Documents/Code/RhythmFit/RhythmFit-Frontend
npm install

5. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start your React app:

npm start

This will launch the application at http://localhost:3000.
